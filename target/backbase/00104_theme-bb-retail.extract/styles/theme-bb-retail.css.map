flex-direction: column).\n * Choose from start (browser default), end, center, between, or around.\n *\n * Use align-items utilities on flexbox containers to change the alignment of flex items\n * on the cross axis (the y-axis to start, x-axis if flex-direction: column).\n * Choose from start, end, center, baseline, or stretch (browser default).\n *\n * Use align-self utilities on flexbox items to individually change their alignment\n * on the cross axis (the y-axis to start, x-axis if flex-direction: column).\n * Choose from the same options as align-items:\n * start, end, center, baseline, or stretch (browser default).\n *\n * Change how flex items wrap in a flex container.\n * Choose from no wrapping at all (the browser default) with .flex-nowrap,\n * wrapping with .flex-wrap, or reverse wrapping with .flex-wrap-reverse.\n *\n * Change the visual order of specific flex items with a handful of order utilities.\n * Only options provided are first or last, as well as a reset to use the DOM order.\n *\n * Use align-content utilities on flexbox containers to align flex items together on the cross axis.\n * Choose from start (browser default), end, center, between, around, or

This is because those classes\n * are applied from min-width: 0 and up, and thus are not bound by a media query.\n * The remaining breakpoints, however, do include a breakpoint abbreviation.\n *\n * The classes are named using the format {property}{sides}-{size}\n * for xs and {property}{sides}-{breakpoint}-{size} for sm, md, and lg.\n *\n * Where property is one of:\n *\n * m - for classes that set margin\n * p - for classes that set padding\n * Where sides is one of:\n *\n * t - for classes that set margin-top or padding-top\n * b - for classes that set margin-bottom or padding-bottom\n * l - for classes that set margin-left or padding-left\n * r - for classes that set margin-right or padding-right\n * x - for classes that set both *-left and *-right\n * y - for classes that set both *-top and *-bottom\n * blank - for classes that set a margin or padding on all 4 sides of the element\n * Where size is one of:\n *\n * 0 - for classes that eliminate the margin or padding by setting it to 0\n * 025 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * .25\n * 0.5 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * 0.5\n * 1 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer\n * 2 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * 2\n * 3 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * 3\n *\n * Additionally, Bootstrap also includes an .mx-auto class for horizontally centering\n * fixed-width block level content—that is, content that has display: block\n * and a width set—by setting the horizontal margins to auto.\n *\n * Here are some examples:\n * .mt-0 {\n *   margin-top: 0;\n * }\n *\n * .ml-025 {\n *   margin-left: ($spacer * .25);\n * }\n *\n * .px-2 {\n *   padding-left: ($spacer * 2);\n *   padding-right: ($spacer * 2);\n * }\n *\n * .p-1 {\n *   padding: $spacer;\n * }\n */\n.m-0 {\n  margin: 0;

padding values to an element\n * or a subset of its sides with shorthand classes.\n * Includes support for individual properties, all properties,\n * and vertical and horizontal properties\n *\n * Notation:\n * Spacing utilities that apply to all breakpoints, from xs to lg,\n * have no breakpoint abbreviation in them. This is because those classes\n * are applied from min-width: 0 and up, and thus are not bound by a media query.\n * The remaining breakpoints, however, do include a breakpoint abbreviation.\n *\n * The classes are named using the format {property}{sides}-{size}\n * for xs and {property}{sides}-{breakpoint}-{size} for sm, md, and lg.\n *\n * Where property is one of:\n *\n * m - for classes that set margin\n * p - for classes that set padding\n * Where sides is one of:\n *\n * t - for classes that set margin-top or padding-top\n * b - for classes that set margin-bottom or padding-bottom\n * l - for classes that set margin-left or padding-left\n * r - for classes that set margin-right or padding-right\n * x - for classes that set both *-left and *-right\n * y - for classes that set both *-top and *-bottom\n * blank - for classes that set a margin or padding on all 4 sides of the element\n * Where size is one of:\n *\n * 0 - for classes that eliminate the margin or padding by setting it to 0\n * 025 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * .25\n * 0.5 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * 0.5\n * 1 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer\n * 2 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * 2\n * 3 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * 3\n *\n * Additionally, Bootstrap also includes an .mx-auto class for horizontally centering\n * fixed-width block level content—that is, content that has display: block\n * and a width set—by setting the horizontal margins to auto.\n *\n * Here are some examples:\n * .mt-0 {\n *   margin-top: 0;\n * }\n *\n * .ml-025 {\n *   margin-left: ($spacer * .25);\n * }\n *\n * .px-2 {\n *
